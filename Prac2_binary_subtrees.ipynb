        "\n",
        "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
        "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
        "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
        "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring.\n",
        "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To be able to obtain a full grade (10), you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate one the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
        "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM?\n",
        "- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?\n",
        "- Or... your own research question!\n",
        "\n",
        "These examples should give you an idea of the expected scope of your further investigations. The maximum number of points awarded for these further investigations depends on the depth of your analysis, and can also be awarded for one of the further research questions already listed above.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.\n",
        "More precisely, you should run each model with 3 different seeds, and for each of these 3 runs, evaluate the best model (according to the validation) on the test dataset. The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

        "- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way.\n",
        "- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point.\n",
        "- Do not spend space on \"obvious\" things.\n",
        "- Do not go over the page limit. (We will deduct points for that.)\n",
        "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. This is a strict limit; points will be deducted for longer reports.\n",
        "- There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix.\n",

        "- Precise, scientific, technical, to the point\n",
        "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
        "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
        "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
        "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
        "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
        "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
        "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
